- Known for its readable, English‑like syntax and strong emphasis on code clarity.

**Key Features**  
- **Simple syntax** – great for beginners and rapid development.  
- **Dynamic typing** – variables don’t need explicit type declarations.  
- **Extensive standard library** – handles everything from file I/O to networking.  
- **Cross‑platform** – runs on Windows, macOS,
USER: Ok, ok, that's it,
ASSISTANT: Got it! If you have any more questions later, just let me know. Happy coding!

ASSISTANT: Hello jira, I'm ready to help.
USER: Hello?
ASSISTANT: Hi there! How can I assist you today?
USER: Okay. Me about Python.
ASSISTANT: Sure! Python is a high‑level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It uses indentation to define code blocks, which makes the syntax clean and easy to learn. Python supports multiple programming paradigms—procedural, object‑oriented, and functional—so you can choose the style that fits your project.
USER: Is it powerful in JavaScript?
ASSISTANT: Python and JavaScript serve different roles, but they can complement each other.

* **Different runtimes** – Python runs on the server (or locally), while JavaScript runs in the browser. You can’t execute raw Python code directly
USER: That's it for today. That's it for today.
ASSISTANT: Got it! Feel free to reach out whenever you have more questions. Have a great day!
USER: Okay.
